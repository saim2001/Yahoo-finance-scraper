Lightwave Logic ,LWLG,NA-editorial@proactiveinvestors.com,"Vancouver, Canada --News Direct-- Lightwave Logic Inc Lightwave Logic CEO Michael Lebby joined Steve Darling from Proactive to shared significant developments at the company, highlighting its pioneering work in electro-optic (EO) polymers for data transmission. Firstly, Lebby announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent for a process that enhances the stability and performance of Lightwave Logic's EO chromophores. These chromophores are essential components of the company's platform, which utilizes engineered EO polymers to transmit data at higher speeds and lower power consumption, all within a compact form factor. Lebby expressed confidence that this patent addition to their portfolio will facilitate more commercial license deals for their EO polymers, particularly with high-volume manufacturing silicon foundries and 200mm silicon wafers. Lebby emphasized that Lightwave Logic is at the forefront of developing EO polymers for data transmission, similar to organic materials used in OLED displays. These polymers enable the high-speed switching of light, primarily benefiting data centers, telecommunications networks, and the broader internet. The company's focus is on meeting the increasing demand for faster data transmission and lower energy consumption, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence and the consequent need for enhanced computational power in data centers. Furthermore, Lightwave Logic recently participated in the Optical Fiber Conference (OFC), showcasing its technological advancements, including a record-setting 200 gigabits per second data transmission at low voltages. The company has also been securing patents to protect its innovative technology, with the latest patent related to its ""diamond I"" technology formulation. Overall, Lightwave Logic aims to make its EO polymers as ubiquitous as organic LEDs in displays by engaging with a broad range of customers for licensing and usage in their devices. The company's strategy involves demonstrating the superiority of its technology to meet the urgent need for network upgrades in the data center industry, driven by the demands of generative artificial intelligence.

That equals February’s self-mining outcome, when Gryphon’s score tied 2 nd  and when its peers who release information averaged 44 BTC/EH, it said. Gryphon generated approximately 45 bitcoin coins while establishing a new company milestone for an average self-mining hashing power of 912 PH/s in March, it stated.  The company held 59 bitcoin in treasury by March 31 and the average machine efficiency remained at 28.9 J/T, it added. The company said it purchased a set of Bitmain S21 200 TH/s machines as part of its machine upgrade program. Furthermore, 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 of its operations are electrified by zero-carbon emitting Hydro power, it said. “We are delighted to report the beginning of our miner upgrade program as we have purchased a batch of Bitmain S21 200 TH/s miners to replace a portion of our older fleet of machines,” said Rob Chang, Gryphon’s CEO. “ Once fully deployed, this improvement is expected add approximately 23 PH/s to our hashing power and reduce our average fleet efficiency to 28.5 J/T. We expect these machines to be deployed within the next few weeks,” he declared.  In March, Gryphon became the first bitcoin miner to release detailed data on carbon emissions including two annual assessments from CarbonChain, a third-party platform.    Contact: Executives-Edge.com Editor@executives-edge.com",,,,,
